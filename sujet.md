# Practical Session #1: Introduction

1. Find in news sources a general public article reporting the discovery of a software bug. Describe the bug. If possible, say whether the bug is local or global and describe the failure that manifested its presence. Explain the repercussions of the bug for clients/consumers and the company or entity behind the faulty program. Speculate whether, in your opinion, testing the right scenario would have helped to discover the fault.

2. Apache Commons projects are known for the quality of their code and development practices. They use dedicated issue tracking systems to discuss and follow the evolution of bugs and new features. The following link https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-794?filter=doneissues points to the issues considered as solved for the Apache Commons Collections project. Among those issues find one that corresponds to a bug that has been solved. Classify the bug as local or global. Explain the bug and the solution. Did the contributors of the project add new tests to ensure that the bug is detected if it reappears in the future?

3. Netflix is famous, among other things we love, for the popularization of *Chaos Engineering*, a fault-tolerance verification technique. The company has implemented protocols to test their entire system in production by simulating faults such as a server shutdown. During these experiments they evaluate the system's capabilities of delivering content under different conditions. The technique was described in [a paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.05843.pdf) published in 2016. Read the paper and briefly explain what are the concrete experiments they perform, what are the requirements for these experiments, what are the variables they observe and what are the main results they obtained. Is Netflix the only company performing these experiments? Speculate how these experiments could be carried in other organizations in terms of the kind of experiment that could be performed and the system variables to observe during the experiments.

4. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) has become the fourth official language supported by web browsers. The language was born from a joint effort of the major players in the Web. Its creators presented their design decisions and the formal specification in [a scientific paper](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/papers/Haas,%20Rossberg,%20Schuff,%20Titzer,%20Gohman,%20Wagner,%20Zakai,%20Bastien,%20Holman%20-%20Bringing%20the%20Web%20up%20to%20Speed%20with%20WebAssembly.pdf) published in 2018. The goal of the language is to be a low level, safe and portable compilation target for the Web and other embedding environments. The authors say that it is the first industrial strength language designed with formal semantics from the start. This evidences the feasibility of constructive approaches in this area. Read the paper and explain what are the main advantages of having a formal specification for WebAssembly. In your opinion, does this mean that WebAssembly implementations should not be tested? 

5.  Shortly after the appearance of WebAssembly another paper proposed a mechanized specification of the language using Isabelle. The paper can be consulted here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~caw77/papers/mechanising-and-verifying-the-webassembly-specification.pdf. This mechanized specification complements the first formalization attempt from the paper. According to the author of this second paper, what are the main advantages of the mechanized specification? Did it help improving the original formal specification of the language? What other artifacts were derived from this mechanized specification? How did the author verify the specification? Does this new specification removes the need for testing?

## Answers
1- A significant software bug was recently discovered in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S24 series, which includes the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra models. The bug primarily affected the Secure Folder feature, a critical security mechanism designed to protect sensitive files and apps on the device. The flaw allowed unauthorized access to this protected area, bypassing the necessary authentication (such as PIN, password, or biometric verification). This bug was a global issue, as it was identified and patched in a security update rolled out to Galaxy S24 users worldwide. Given the Secure Folder's critical role in protecting personal data, this flaw was particularly alarming for all users of the Galaxy S24 series, potentially putting millions at risk of unauthorized data exposure. The vulnerability enabled attackers to get around the necessary authentication procedures, such providing a PIN or utilizing biometric verification, even though the system was meant to prevent unwanted access. Therefore, without the owner's consent, any sensitive information kept in the Secure Folder may be accessed. For users who relied on their phones for work, this revealed potentially sensitive commercial information in addition to jeopardizing the privacy of personal files. For users, the bug posed a serious risk of data theft or exposure, the unauthorized access could lead to identity theft, financial loss, or the leaking of personal or business secrets. As for Samsung repercussions were significant, particularly in terms of its reputation for delivering secure devices. The Galaxy S24 series is a flagship line, and such a security lapse could degrade customer trust. In our opinion It is possible that deeper testing scenarios, with a focus on penetration testing and attempts to get beyond authentication measures, discovered this issue prior to the device's release. The vulnerability may have been discovered through testing scenarios that imitate unwanted access attempts or that exceed the limits of the Secure Folder's security controls.

2-The PassiveExpiringMap is a class in Apache Commons Collections that implements a map with time-based entries. Each entry automatically expires after a specified duration, meaning the map removes the entry if it hasn't been accessed or modified within that time. This feature is useful for managing resources that should only exist temporarily, such as caching mechanisms, where unused data is purged to free up memory. The expiration is "passive" because entries are removed only when they are accessed after their expiry time, not actively by a background thread.
In https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-786?filter=doneissues
A bug was found, where methods like containsKey(Object) are supposed to access the entire donâ€™t do so. The solution is to alter the methods with others that access the entire map, for example containsKey() was altered by containsValue(Object) that do give access to the whole map.
The bug was local.

3- A tool named Chaos Monkey and other Simian Army parts are used in Netflix's Chaos Engineering experiments. These tools cause malfunctions in the working environment like : 
    - _Server shutdowns_: Chaos Monkey randomly terminates instances in their production to observe how the system responds when a service becomes unavailable.
    - _Network Latency and Redirecting Client Requests_ : Netflix uses Latency Monkey as a way to simulate network delays to test how the system handled increased response time and to ensure that it still can function under such conditions. Also, they use Chaos Kong to take an entire region offline, they redirect client requests to other regions and observe the effects on system performance and user experience. 
    - _Failure Injection Testing_ : They simulate  the unavailability of the bookmark service for a subset of users while keeping it operational for others. This allows them to measure the impact of the service failure on user experience without affecting all users.
    The prerequisites for conducting these experiments involve establishing control and experimental groups to compare standard conditions with those involving simulated failures, defining the steady state by identifying measurable outputs that represent typical system behavior, and adding realistic variables, such as server crashes and network failures, to simulate real-world events. For these experiments to be carried out continuously, automation is necessary. Monitoring tools are used to measure metrics and assess impacts. In order to combine realism with prospective risks, careful risk management is also required. Key variables noticed in these experiments include overall system performance metrics, error rates, response times, service availability, and user experience metrics like signups per second. The main findings provide insightful information about resilience, including enhanced error handling, reduced performance impact from specific service outages, a deeper comprehension of system behavior under failure scenarios, validated successful failover strategies, and a basis for ongoing system reliability improvement.
    These experiments are being carried out by other companies than Netflix. Chaos engineering techniques have been embraced by other significant digital giants including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook in order to guarantee the dependability and resilience of their systems. These businesses have created custom frameworks and instruments to carry out comparable studies in their own settings.     

4. Compared to using regular javaScript to develop apps for the web, Web Assembly offers many advantages aiming to solve all the issues that come with javaScript. The main advantages of having a formal spec for WebAssembly is **Precision and rigor**, it permits to eliminate any sort of ambiguities making sure all implementation follow the same rules. **Soundness Guarantees** like type safety and memory safety =, And finally **Error Detection**, this formal approach help detect errors and improve the language's reliability.

5. The advantages of the mechanized specification :
* **Formal soundness Proof**: It offers a confirmed demonstration of the type system soundness of WebAssembly, which has never been done previously.
*  **Error Identification** : It affected the official development by helping to identify and fix a number of problems with the initial formal specification.

The other artifacts that were derived from this mechanized  spec :   
* **Verified Interpreter** : An executable interpreter built from the formal spec,It permits WebAssembly programs to be executed, guaranteeing that, when executed, it operates as anticipated.
* **Type Checker** : guarantees proper typing of WebAssembly programs in accordance with the language's spec. In terms of the formal typing relation, it is full and sound.

About the verification, it was done by testing with conformance suites and fuzzing. However, this new spec does not remove the need for testing, it's just an addition to the formal proof.
